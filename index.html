    <!-- Code a number guessing game that generates a random number and evaluates it against the user's guess which should be retrieved from the HTML DOM. If the user guesses the randomized number, they win. If they don't guess it, they will be able to try again until they guess the number correctly. The guessing game must tell them if their guess is too high or too low. The game must generate a random number from 1-100 and should NOT generate a new random number each time the user submits a guess. -->
